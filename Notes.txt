Lifecycle Methods


#Mounting lifecycle methods
    constructor() : The constructor method is called before the component is mounted to the DOM.
    static getDerivedStateFromProps() : Its main function is to ensure that the state and props are in sync for when itâ€™s required.
    render()
    componentDidMount() : This function is invoked immediately after the component is mounted to the DOM. Run only for the first time.

#Updating lifecycle methods
    static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    shouldComponentUpdate() : Once the static getDerivedStateFromProps method is called, the shouldComponentUpdate method is called next.
    render()
    getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() : The getSnapshotBeforeUpdate lifecycle method stores the previous values of the state after the DOM is updated. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() is called right after the render method.
    componentDidUpdate() : Run everytime when props and state change

#Unmounting lifecycle method
    componentWillUnmount : The componentWillUnmount lifecycle method is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.

#Error handling lifecycle methods
    static getDerivedStateFromError() : Whenever an error is thrown in a child component, this method is called first, and the error thrown passed as an argument.
    componentDidCatch() : The componentDidCatch method is also called after an error in a descendant component is thrown. Apart from the error thrown, it is passed one more argument which represents more information about the error.
